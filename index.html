			<h3 id="about" class = "light dark">Hey!</h3>
			<p>I'm all about where the phyical world meets the digital world. I live and develop in HTX.</p>
			<p>As an optimist about bringing automation to life applications, I'm interested in:</p>
			<ul class="light dark">
				<li> Websites that enable IoT devices to make life smarter.</li>
				<li> Faster wireless speeds, like 5G, that enable completely different experiences of life on the go.</li>
				<li> Seamless interactions between robotic and autonomous systems, and the humans that benefit from them.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class = "light dark">More About Kenny</h3>
			<p> I grew up in the burbs of Chicago and went to college out east, majoring in Mechanical Engineering.
				I'm currently creating a home appliance called the <a href="https://phasefilter.com">Phase Filter</a> and I'm also learning the skills to be a web developer. 
				I live in Houston, where I spent close to a decade working for a major oil and gas company where I had roles in operations & maintenance, sensors/automation/robotics implementation,
				and innovation/product development. The day after I made this website, my wife and I had our daughter Kaia. She's our second child and I'm looking forward to watching her grow like
				her older brother.</p>
