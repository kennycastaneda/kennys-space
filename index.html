			<h2 class = "light dark">Hello!</h2>
			<p>I'm all about where the phsyical world meets the digital world. I live and develop in Space City (aka Houston, Texas).</p>
			<p>As an optimist about automation of everyday tasks, I'm interested in:</p>
			<ul class="light dark">
				<li> Websites that enable IoT devices to make life smarter.</li>
				<li> Faster wireless speeds, like 5G, that enable completely different experiences of life-on-the-go.</li>
				<li> Seamless interactions between robotic/autonomous systems, and the humans that benefit from them.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class = "light dark">More About Kenny</h2>
			<p> I grew up in the burbs of Chicago and went to college at Yale, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. 
				I'm currently creating a home appliance called the <a href="https://phasefilter.com" target="_blank">Phase Filter</a>. I'm also learning web development through a bootcamp called Thinkful. I love to invent things (and have a few patents pending) and I'm constantly thinking about products to bring into the world.
				I live in Houston, where I spent close to a decade working for a major oil and gas company where I had roles in operations & maintenance, sensors, automation, & robotics implementation,
				and innovation & product development.</p>
			<p>
				You can learn more about my professional accomplishments as an engineer at my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/kennethcastaneda" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. I enjoy going on outdoor adventures with my kids, traveling the world with my wife, and exploring HTX restaurants with friends and family.
			</p>
			<p>I'm excited to start a career as a web developer. I love to be part of teams that share the common goal of improving lives through the products they build. It's always fun to brainstorm, collaborate, and innovate with teammates.</p>

					<p>An automatically changing air filter for your home. This site is built using Square Space starting back in 2018. It was a great introduction to some of the mechanisms involved with creating a website. The product is still undergoing development but there are exciting partnerships underworks for testing out our matured prototypes.</p>

					<p>A razor handle in the shape of a hook for stylish storage. This is one of my first websites built from web development lessons. I'm utilizing bootstrap for styling the site. I'm currently at a stage when I'm learning how to use a server to accept payments utilizing Stripe APIs.</p>

I'm currently working on a website to showcase the product for purchase. <a href="http://lactationstation.co">LactationStation.co</a> is the parked website.</p>

					<p>A website with product recommendations to live "well" past 100 years old. I'm currently reading up on ways to live past one hundred years old, but also be healthy at that age. This site allows me to share my knowledge. I built the site using FlexBox as a styling means for the products I'm sharing. I believe as I learn more about other CSS frameworks, these products can be presented more attractively for people to click through.</p>

					<p>This is a brochure to a "one night trial" service when purchasing a home. This is at an idea stage but open to test out the concept. It would work well utilizing an existing platform, like AirBNB. It would require listed homes to be vacant and stages with basic amenities.</p>
