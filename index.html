		<h3 href="About">More About Kenny</h3>
        <p> I grew up in the burbs of Chicago and went to college out east, majoring in Mechanical Engineering.
			I'm currently creating a home appliance called the <a href="https://phasefilter.com">Phase Filter</a> and I'm also learning the skills to be a web developer. 
			I live in Houston, where I spent close to a decade working for a major oil and gas company where I had roles in operations & maintenance, sensors/automation/robotics implementation,
			and innovation/product development. The day after I made this website, our daughter Kaia was born (12/2/20). She's our second child and I'm looking forward to watching her grow like
			her older brother.</p>
