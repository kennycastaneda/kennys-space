			<p>I'm all about where the phyical world meets the digital world. I live and develop in Space City (aka Houston, Texas).</p>
			<p>As an optimist about automation of everyday tasks, I'm interested in:</p>
			<ul class="light dark">
				<li> Websites that enable IoT devices to make life smarter.</li>
				<li> Faster wireless speeds, like 5G, that enable completely different experiences of life-on-the-go.</li>
				<li> Seamless interactions between robotic/autonomous systems, and the humans that benefit from them.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class = "light dark">More About Kenny</h3>
			<p> I grew up in the burbs of Chicago and went to college out east, majoring in Mechanical Engineering.
				I'm currently creating a home appliance called the <a href="https://phasefilter.com">Phase Filter</a> and I'm also learning the skills to be a web developer. I love to invent things and I'm constantly thinking about products to bring into the world.
				I live in Houston, where I spent close to a decade working for a major oil and gas company where I had roles in operations & maintenance, sensors/automation/robotics implementation,
				and innovation/product development.</p>
			<p>
				You can learn more about my professional accomplishments as an engineer at my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/kennethcastaneda">LinkedIn</a>. I enjoy going on outdoor adventures with my kids, traveling the world with my wife, and exploring HTX restaurants with friends and family.
